## Footnotes
The original Godot logo is just fine, I don't want to throw any shade on it. I like the fact it is friendly: it reminds me of the smiling face used for many years on Mac OS. Anyway, I saw another user make a slightly cuter version and I therefore decided to push the envelope and see just how cute it could be. I tried to push it to 11, did I succeed?
